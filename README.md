# PinFlags

A lightweight Rails engine for managing entity based features with built-in caching support. "Pin features" to any ActiveRecord model with ease, providing a slightly different take on traditional feature flags.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Polymorphic "feature tags" which can be tied to any ActiveRecord Model 
- âš¡ Built-in caching with configurable expiry
- ðŸŽ¨ An admn UI that stays out of your way with minified BulmaCSS and AplineJS
- ðŸ”’ Isolated namespace to avoid conflicts
- ðŸ’‰ No dependency on Stimulus 

## Dependencies
- Rails 7.0 or higher with Turbo
- Ruby 3.0 or higher

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "pin_flags"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ rails g pin_flags:install
```

Run the migration to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```

### Basic Configuration

Configure PinFlags in an initializer (e.g., `config/initializers/pin_flags.rb`):

```ruby
PinFlags.config do |config|
  config.cache_prefix = "my_app_flags"  # Default: "pin_flags"
  config.cache_expiry = 1.hour          # Default: 12.hours
end
```

## Usage

### Include the module in any of your ActiveRecord models:

```ruby
class SomeModel < ApplicationRecord
  include PinFlags::FeatureTaggable
end
```

### What this does:

Including `PinFlags::FeatureTaggable` in your model adds the following capabilities:

- **Polymorphic associations**: Your model gets `feature_subscriptions` and `feature_tags` associations
- **Feature flag checking**: Methods to check if specific features are enabled/disabled for instances
- **Pin/Unpin operations**: Ability to add or remove feature tags from individual records
- **Cached lookups**: Feature flag status is cached for performance

### Example Usage

```ruby
# Include the module in your models
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include PinFlags::FeatureTaggable
end

class Organization < ApplicationRecord
  include PinFlags::FeatureTaggable
end

# Create some feature tags
PinFlags::FeatureTag.create!(name: "premium_features", enabled: true)
PinFlags::FeatureTag.create!(name: "beta_features", enabled: true)
PinFlags::FeatureTag.create!(name: "deprecated_ui", enabled: false)

# Working with individual records
user = User.find(1)

# Pin a feature to a user (creates the tag if it doesn't exist)
user.feature_tag_pin("premium_features")

# Check if user has a specific feature tag
user.feature_tag?("premium_features")           # => true
user.feature_tag?("nonexistent_feature")       # => false

# Check if a feature is enabled for the user
user.feature_tag_enabled?("premium_features")  # => true
user.feature_tag_enabled?("deprecated_ui")     # => false (tag exists but disabled)

# Check if a feature is disabled for the user
user.feature_tag_disabled?("deprecated_ui")    # => true

# Remove a feature tag from a user
user.feature_tag_unpin("premium_features")

# Access all feature tags for a user
user.feature_tags                               # => ActiveRecord collection
user.feature_tags.enabled                      # => Only enabled tags
user.feature_tags.disabled                     # => Only disabled tags

# Bulk operations using the model directly
PinFlags::FeatureSubscription.create_in_bulk(
  feature_tag: PinFlags::FeatureTag.find_by(name: "beta_features"),
  feature_taggable_type: "User",
  feature_taggable_ids: User.where(some_boolean_attribute: true).pluck(:id)
)

# Global feature flag management
PinFlags::FeatureTag.enable("new_dashboard")   # Enable globally
PinFlags::FeatureTag.enabled?("new_dashboard") # Check if globally enabled
PinFlags::FeatureTag.disable("old_feature")   # Disable globally
PinFlags::FeatureTag.disabled?("old_feature") # Check if globally disabled

# Check if a feature is enabled for a specific subscriber
PinFlags::FeatureTag.enabled_for_subscriber?("premium_features", user)
```

### Available Methods

**Instance methods added to your model:**
- `feature_tag_pin(tag_name)` - Pin a feature tag to this record
- `feature_tag_unpin(tag_name)` - Remove a feature tag from this record  
- `feature_tag?(tag_name)` - Check if this record has a feature tag
- `feature_tag_enabled?(tag_name)` - Check if feature is enabled for this record
- `feature_tag_disabled?(tag_name)` - Check if feature is disabled for this record
- `feature_tags` - Get all feature tags for this record
- `feature_subscriptions` - Get all feature subscriptions for this record

**Class methods for feature management:**
- `PinFlags::FeatureTag.enable(tag_name)` - Enable a feature globally
- `PinFlags::FeatureTag.disable(tag_name)` - Disable a feature globally
- `PinFlags::FeatureTag.enabled_for_subscriber?(tag_name, record)` - Check if enabled for specific record


### Mounting the Engine

Add PinFlags to your routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount PinFlags::Engine, at: "/pin_flags"
  # your other routes...
end
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `cache_prefix` | Prefix for cache keys | `"pin_flags"` |
| `cache_expiry` | Cache expiration time | `12.hours` |

## Development
